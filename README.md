# Income_Prediction
Using the attached data ("ml_dataset.csv"),
build a model which predicts the target variable “income”.
we show the basic parts of our  process, and try at least 2 different models (would be nice to see one of them be a more ambitious model, like a neural network).
Share the code and results for this task in reproducible format.
